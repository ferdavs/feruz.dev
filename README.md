# Experience

## Fraunhofer ISC-HTL, Software Engineer - Student Assistant

- Dec. 2021 to Apr. 2024 
- Bayreuth, Germany 
- Sensor data from InfluxDB was complex to analyze. I developed software to acquire and analyze sensor data, improving usability and efficiency.
- Sensor data monitoring was challenging. Implemented visualization tool using PyQt 5 and PyQTGraph.
- I developed a Python library to parse and reformat historical sensor data using pandas, streamlining data processing workflows.
- I assisted in configuring GitLab CICD for Linux and Windows deployments, and implemented automated deployment processes for both environments.
- Technologies: **Python, InfluxDB, PyQt5, PyQTGraph, GitLab CI/CD, Pandas, Git, Docker, numpy**

## Crossover, Java Software Engineer

- July 2018 to Aug. 2020 
- Remote 
- Critical issues and performance challenges affecting reliability have been resolved. As a member of maintenance team of **Jive software**, contributed to the platform's reliability by fixing critical issues.
- Platform integration with tools needed rewriting. Issues related to Microsoft O365, SharePoint, Google Drive, and Box were fixed. As a result users gained reliable and improved functionality.
- Technologies: **Java, Spring, Microservices, RestApi, Microsoft O365, SharePoint, Google Drive, Box, Docker, Jira**

## Kollektif House, Java Backend and Android Engineer

- May 2017 to July 2018 
- Istanbul, Turkey 
- The financial portfolio app lacked additional analysis and metrics like beta, Sharpe ratio, etc. I contributed to developing analysis with insights and analytics, providing users with informed investment decision-making capabilities.
- The Galatasaray Football Team's fan experience needed enhancement. I contributed to developing the Java backend and Android app, improving fan engagement and digital experience.
- Technologies: **Java, Android, Play Framework,Django,Javascript,RestApi, PostgreSQL, Docker, Asana, Git**

## Mavili Elektronik, Software Engineer

- July 2013 to Aug. 2015 
- Istanbul, Turkey 
- Fire and smoke detection software had limited communication. I have developed software from scratch with Serial, GPRS, and TCP communication, enhancing communication capabilities and system functionality.
- Server could connect only 200 sensors. Implemented asynchronous sensor-server communication. Increased number of connected sensors from 200 to 1000.
- Technologies: **C#.NET,MS SQL Server, RS232, GPRS, TCP, UDP, Git**
